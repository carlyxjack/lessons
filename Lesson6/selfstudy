I couldn't answer question2
queston3: Line consist of one line, while Lines consist of more lines??
Question 4: Which plotting options do you prefer? E.g spplot or plot?
I prefer spplot, since there is one function instead of a few functions.
Question 5: What happens if you change quadsegs to a higher number? higher segments -> smoother circle
Question 6: Do you understand the script? What is the difference between gIntersection and gDifference?
